My name is **Paola Echave** and I'm a **Ph.D. candidate** in **Sociology** 

I grew up in Bolivia and am currently finishing my Ph.D. in Sociology at the Ohio State University. Throughout my graduate education, I have volunteered in several organizations aimed at promoting the professional advancement of Latinx individuals in the U.S. My experience as an immigrant along with the fundamental knowledge I gained while working in community based organizations have shaped my research interests. I continue to be actively involved in matters that impact my community by volunteering or even providing consultation services.
