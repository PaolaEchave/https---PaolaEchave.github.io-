My name is **Paola Andrea Echave** and I'm a **Senior Research Associate** at the **Urban Institute** 

My experience as an immigrant from Bolivia living in the US, the fundamental knowledge I gained through the completion of a PhD in Sociology and working with community based organizations have shaped my research interests and provided me with the foundation to develop meaningful research with a policy focus. I am actively involved in matters that impact my community by volunteering or even providing consultation services. Currently, I am a Senior Research Associate in the Tax and Income Supports Division at the Urban Institute. My research focuses on immigration, population health, demography, life course perspectives, health disparities, trauma, and race/ethnicity. I have extensive training in quantitative and qualitative methods, data collection and survey design in multiple languages, and experience with development and analyses of large-scale social science and demographic surveys. I have served as a technical expert for various demographic and international projects in Central America and Sub-Saharan Africa. My research has been published in peer reviewed journals and has been featured in many media outlets including ScienceDaily, Ohio State News, Fox 8 News, Chicago Tribune, and international outlets, such as UK Times.
