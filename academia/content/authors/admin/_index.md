In my dissertation, I use various data sources, including the U.S. Census, to study the impact of immigration enforcement on the well-being of Hispanic communities in the U.S. 

Throughout my graduate education, I worked and maintained effective relationships and communications with project sponsors and external stakeholders, including undergraduate students, the Latinx Space for Enrichment and Research, the Institute for Population Research, and the National Coalition for Latinxs with Disabilities (CNLD). I continue to strenghten these relationships by collaborating or leading team projects and providing guidance on how to complete a demographic or international study.

My specialized experience consists of reviewing and analyzing data from censuses and large-scale social science and demographic surveys. I also serve as a technical expert for various demographic and international projects and developed research programs that are carried out by others under my guidance.

In order to promote the academic developemt of other students and professionals, I create R tutorials and statistical analyses workshops in Spanish/English and present this information to students, researchers, and organizations.
